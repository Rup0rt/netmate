netmate v0.2.0 README
*********************

Netmate is a GTK+ program that shows network protocols headers in 32-bit
aligned fields, identical as they are represented in Request for Comments
(RFCs). It can be used to learn and teach about network protocols and to
understand their functionality and collaboration.

This tool supports input files in pcap(ng) format as they are created by
tcpdump, wireshark or other code based on libpcap.

Netmate is written in C and released under the GNU General Public License.
It was inspired by netdude, that is not further developed any more.

Currently the following network protocols are supported:
- Layer 2: Ethernet, SLL (Linux Cooked)
- Layer 3: ARP, ICMP, ICMPv6, IPv4, IPv6
- Layer 4: TCP, UDP

This tool is still under development! Please send any further wishes, feature
requests or problems in compiling and execution to ruport@f00l.de. Also send
me any more network protocols you want to be supported in future releases.
